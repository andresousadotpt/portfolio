                    I'm a DevOps Engineer with 1+ years of experience building
                    and maintaining robust CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as
                    code, and cloud-native solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My approach focuses on implementing DevOps best practices to
                    bridge the gap between development and operations, enabling
                    teams to deliver software faster and more reliably.
